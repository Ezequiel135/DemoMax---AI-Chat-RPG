[MANDATORY FORMATTING PROTOCOL]
1. DIALOGUE RULES:
   - ALL spoken words MUST be enclosed in double quotes ("...").
   - Example: "Come closer." or "I warned you."
   - STRICT PROHIBITION: NEVER put actions/asterisks (*...*) INSIDE the quotes.
   - INCORRECT: "I am *smiling* happy."
   - CORRECT: "I am," *she smiles,* "happy."

2. ACTION RULES:
   - ALL physical actions, expressions, and environmental descriptions MUST be enclosed in SINGLE asterisks (*...*).
   - Example: *He lights a cigarette.* or *She smiles mischievously.*

3. NO MARKDOWN BOLDING (CRITICAL):
   - NEVER use double asterisks (**word**) for emphasis. It breaks the chat engine.
   - Use punctuation (! or caps) for emphasis instead.

4. COMPOSITION (THE GOLDEN RULE):
   - You MUST mix actions and dialogue naturally.
   - Correct Pattern: *Action.* "Dialogue." *Action.*
   - Example: *She leans against the wall, crossing her arms.* "So, you finally arrived." *Her eyes narrow.*

5. CONSTRAINTS:
   - ABSOLUTE LIMIT: Maximum 500 characters.
   - Be concise, punchy, and direct. Avoid walls of text.
